\details{
The \code{LSM_american_option} function provides an implementation of the least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation approach to numerically approximate
the value of American-style options (options with early exercise opportunities). The function provides flexibility in the stochastic process followed by the underlying asset, with simulated values
of stochastic processes provided within the \code{state_variables} argument. It also provides flexibility in the payoffs of the option, allowing for vanilla as well as more exotic options to be considered.
\code{LSM_american_option} also provides analysis into the exercise timing and probability of early exercise of the option.

\bold{Least-Squares Monte Carlo Simulation:}

The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is a numeric approach first presented by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) that
approximates the value of options with early exercise opportunities. The LSM simulation method is considered one of the most efficient
methods of valuing American-style options due to its flexibility and computational efficiency. The approach can feature multiple
stochastically evolving underlying uncertainties, following both standard and exotic stochastic processes.

The LSM method first approximates stochastic variables through a stochastic process to develop cross-sectional information,
then directly estimates the continuation value of in-the-money simulation paths by "(regressing) the ex-post realized payoffs from
continuation on functions of the values of the state variables" (Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001).

The 'LSM_american_option' function at each discrete time period, for each simulated price path, compares the payoff that results from immediate exercise of
the option with the expected value of continuing to hold the option for subsequent periods. The payoff of immediate exercise is provided in the \code{payoff} argument and
could take several different meanings depending upon the type of American-style option being valued (e.g. the current stock price, the maximum price between multiple assets, etc.).

The immediate profit resulting from exercise of the option is dependent upon the type of option being calculated. The profit of price path \eqn{i} and time \eqn{t}
is given by:

When \code{call = TRUE}:
\deqn{profit_{(t,i)} = max(payoff_{(t,i)} - K, 0)}{profit[t,i] = max(payoff[t,i] - K, 0)}

When \code{call = FALSE}:
\deqn{profit_{(t,i)} = max(K - payoff_{(t,i)}, 0)}{profit[t,i] = max(K - payoff[t,i], 0)}

\bold{Orthogonal Polynomials:}

To improve the accuracy of estimation of continuation values, the economic values in each period are regressed on a linear
combination of a set of basis functions of the stochastic variables. These estimated regression parameters and the simulated
stochastic variables are then used to calculate the estimator for the expected economic values.

Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) state that as the conditional expectation of the continuation value belongs to a Hilbert space,
it can be represented by a combination of orthogonal basis functions. Increasing the number of stochastic state variables
therefore increases the number of required basis functions exponentially. The orthogonal polynomials available in the
\code{LSMRealOptions} package are: Laguerre, Jacobi, Legendre (spherical), Hermite (probabilistic), Chebyshev (of the first kind).
The simple powers of state variables is further available. Explicit expressions of each of these orthogonal polynomials are
available within the textbook of Abramowitz and Stegun (1965).

\examples{

# Price a vanilla American put option on an asset that follows
# Geometric Brownian Motion

## Step 1 - simulate stock prices:
stock_prices <- GBM_simulate(n = 100, t = 1, mu = 0.05,
                         sigma = 0.2, S0 = 100, dt = 1/2)

## Step 2 - Value the American put option:
option_value <- LSM_american_option(state_variables = stock_prices,
                                 payoff = stock_prices,
                                 K = 100,
                                 dt = 1/2,
                                 rf = 0.05)
